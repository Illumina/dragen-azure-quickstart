<p>This Quick Start guide provides instructions and resources to guide users through deploying Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (DRAGEN) on Azure.  It is primarily intended for users who are interested in a quick and easy setup for running genomics workloads in the cloud.</p>

<p>This tutorial and its associated Marketplace solution in Azure (TODO: Do we want to link directly to this?) were developed by Illumina in collaboration with Microsoft.  The reference deployment described below serves as a starting point, but can be further customized to meet your needs.</p>

<p>If you run into any issues while going through the tutorial, please <a href="#feedback-and-contributing">share your feedback with us</a>!</p>
