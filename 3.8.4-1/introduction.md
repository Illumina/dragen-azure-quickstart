This Quick Start guide provides instructions and resources to guide users through deploying Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (DRAGEN) on Azure.  It is primarily intended for users who are interested in a quick and easy setup for running genomics workloads in the cloud.

_Note: DRAGEN currently exists as a private offering in the Azure Marketplace.  If you would like to gain access, please contact Illumina at techsupport@illumina.com._

This tutorial and its associated Marketplace solution in Azure were developed by Illumina in collaboration with Microsoft.  The reference deployment described below serves as a starting point, but can be further customized to meet your needs.

If you run into any issues while going through the tutorial, please [share your feedback with us](#contributing)!
